# Daily documentation

## Week 1 (25-04-2022 - 01-05-2022)

### Day 1 (Monday)

Today we did a brainstorming session. We discussed about the sensors we would buy or make. We also had quite a lengthy discussion with Bas about it. We came up with solutions for the DIY sensors.  
We started working the design of the webpage and the collaboration contract.  
We also planned the sprints.  

### Day 2 (Tuesday)

Today, we worked on making a webdesign, to iterate on and give the client an idea of what we want the website to look like. More info on this can be found [here](https://iot.dev.hihva.nl/2021-2022-feb-jun/group-project/teamnl-bmx-windspeed-logging/iot-bmx-team-nl/Front%20end/Website-Design/).  
Secondly, we researched the MyLaps device manual, to check how we can use this device with our product.  
Lastly, we made sure the gitlab pages were setup correctly and documented everything we have done so far.  
We made the following pages:  

- [Sensors](https://iot.dev.hihva.nl/2021-2022-feb-jun/group-project/teamnl-bmx-windspeed-logging/iot-bmx-team-nl/sensors/)  
- [Web application](https://iot.dev.hihva.nl/2021-2022-feb-jun/group-project/teamnl-bmx-windspeed-logging/iot-bmx-team-nl/Front%20end/Web-Application/)
