# Daily documentation

## Week 1 (25-04-2022 - 01-04-2022)

### Day 1 (Monday)

### Day 2 (Tuesday)

Today, we worked on making a webdesign, to iterate on and give the client an idea of what we want the website to look like. More info on this can be found [here](https://iot.dev.hihva.nl/2021-2022-feb-jun/group-project/teamnl-bmx-windspeed-logging/iot-bmx-team-nl/Front%20end/Website-Design/).  
Secondly, we researched the MyLaps device manual, to check how we can use this device with our product.  
Lastly, we made sure the gitlab pages were setup correctly and documented everything we have done so far.  
We made the following pages:  

- [Sensors](https://iot.dev.hihva.nl/2021-2022-feb-jun/group-project/teamnl-bmx-windspeed-logging/iot-bmx-team-nl/sensors/)  
- [Web application](https://iot.dev.hihva.nl/2021-2022-feb-jun/group-project/teamnl-bmx-windspeed-logging/iot-bmx-team-nl/Front%20end/Web-Application/)  
- [Web design](https://iot.dev.hihva.nl/2021-2022-feb-jun/group-project/teamnl-bmx-windspeed-logging/iot-bmx-team-nl/Front%20end/Website-Design/)
