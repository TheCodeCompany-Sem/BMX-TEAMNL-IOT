# Weather proofing

As we need to make the device work outside, we need to make sure it is weatherproof. To make the weather station weather proof, it needs to be able to resist the following:

-	(heavy) rain
-	Strong winds and gusts
-	Possibly lightningbolts?

## Rain

Making the product waterproof is practically impossible, as you need to be able to connect the wires from the wemos to a device, however making it water-resistant is definitely possible. This makes it practically impossible for rain to get into the device. To do this we can use potting compound, like [this one](https://www.f4p-products.com/products/4319079-2-x-150ml-bottles-of-magic-gel). It will make it IP68 rated water resistant, which is the same as all high-end smartphones have nowadays, making it perfectly capable to resist the rain.

### How to apply it to the device

## Wind

Making the device resistant to wind is simply making a good enclosure and finding a way for the wind sensors to stand upright without the risk of it falling over.

## Lightning

Making it resistant to lightning would be very difficult, as a lightning bolt would completely destroy the device. However, the device is already sort of protected against lightning, as the top part of the wind sensor is made of plastic, which does not conduct electricity. In addition to that, we should make sure the device is not the highest point in the nearby area, which would make it highly unlikely to be struck by lightning. This is basically the best we can do.
