# Web Application

## Introduction
For this project there are 2 frameworks we are going to use for our web-application:

- Spring boot (back-end framework)
- Angular 6 (front-end framework)

We will also use a mysql database provided by OEGE to store data.

We will make sure the following functionalities will be implemented on the web-app:

- ability to export data into json-files
- ability for the coach and athlete to see the performance of the athlete
- ability to see improvement of the athlete and what might have affected his/her performance
