# Testing plan

## Background

As of right now, we almost completely finished the product. We made a casing, we made the sensors work and the back-end is also fully working. We want to test whether this product as a whole is fully working and if the casing is actually weatherproof.

## Hypothesis

We think casing will be weatherproof, the back-end will receive the data and the sensors will work accordingly. However, we think the front-end will causes some issues regarding showing the correct data to the user.

## The test

We will go to the location of the client and set the device up on top of the bmx ramp. When the racers use the ramp, we get data from their data system, causing our sensors to measure their data and sent that back to the back-end. The front-end will fetch this data and show it to the users of the website. Our goal is to let this run for about two hours and discuss the progress with the client, receiving feedback along the way.
