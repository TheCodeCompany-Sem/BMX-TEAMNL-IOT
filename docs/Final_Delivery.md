# Final delivery

This document will contain everything we will deliver to the client at the end of the project. That means there will be info here about the hardware and software of the device and any other important information.

## Software

The software is split into a couple of parts, the front-end and the back-end. The front-end is the part which the user can see, the webpages and the looks of it. The back-end are the parts the user cannot see. This includes a database, security and a lot of functionality.

### Front-end

### Back-end

## Physical device

The physical device also consists of multiple parts, which can be explained individually. The 3d print, which is the casing of the device and makes sure the electronics are protected. The wiring, which is how the wires are connected from the sensors to the wemos. Lastly, there is the code on the wemos, this code makes sure the wemos uses the data from the sensors correctly and sends it to the designated location.
